                <strong>Web development</strong> is the work involved in developing a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> for the

            </p>
            
            <p>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building 
                Web sites: writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup</a>
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">coding</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
                Web development may use 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management systems</a> (CMS) to make 
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
            </p>
            
            <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people 
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">Web developers</a>) and follow standard methods
                like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile methodologies</a> while developing Web
                sites.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Techopedia.com-1">[1]</a></sup> 
                Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment 
                to related job positions such as a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer">graphic designer</a> or 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_system">information systems</a> technician.
                Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. 
                There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">front-end developer</a>, back-end developer, 
                and full-stack developer.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
                Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run 
                in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the
                servers.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
                Since the commercialization of 
                the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

            <p>The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of 
                academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. 
                Consequently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> was developed in
                1993.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

            <h1>Web development life cycle</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The web development life cycle is a method that outlines the stages involved in building websites and
                web applications. It provides a structured approach, ensuring optimal results throughout the development
                process. <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">[citation needed]</a></small>
            </p>

            <p>A typical Web Development process can be divided into 7 steps.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web development process can be divided
                into sequential steps. They mentioned different aspects of 
                analysis.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Howcroft-2000-17">[17]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively achieve its goals.
                Keil et al.'s 
                research<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
                identifies the primary reasons for software project failures
                as a lack of top management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. To mitigate these
                risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and objectives, designing a system to fulfill them.
                The decision to establish a web presence should ideally align with the organization's corporate
                information strategy.
            </p>
            <p>The analysis phase can be divided into 3 steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Development of a web strategy</li>
                <li>Defining objectives</li>
                <li>Objective analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During this phase, the previously outlined objectives and available resources undergo analysis to
                determine their feasibility. This analysis is divided into six tasks, as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technology analysis:</strong> Identification of all necessary technological components and tools for
                    constructing, hosting, and supporting the site.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Information analysis:</strong> Identification of user-required information, whether static (web page)
                    or dynamic (pulled "live" from a database server).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Skills analysis:</strong> Identification of the diverse skill sets necessary to complete the project.</li>
                <li><strong>User analysis:</strong> Identification of all intended users of the site, a more intricate process
                    due to the varied range of users and technologies they may use.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cost analysis:</strong> Estimation of the development cost for the site or an evaluation of what is
                    achievable within a predefined budget.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Risk analysis:</strong> Examination of any major risks associated with site development.</li>
                <p>Following this analysis, a more refined set of objectives is documented. Objectives that cannot be
                    presently fulfilled are recorded in a Wish List, constituting part of the Objectives Document.
                    This documentation becomes integral to the iterative process during the subsequent cycle of the
                    methodology.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-Howcroft-2000-17">[17]</a></sup>
                </p>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Planning: sitemap and wireframe</h2>
            <p>It is crucial for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">web developers</a> to be engaged in
                formulating a plan and determining the optimal architecture and selecting the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">frameworks</a>.
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">[citation needed]</a></sup>
                Additionally, developers/consultants play a role in elucidating the total cost of ownership associated with supporting
                a website, which may surpass the initial development expenses.
            </p>
            <p>Key aspects in this step are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">Sitemap</a> creation</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe">Wireframe</a> creation</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack">Tech stack</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    <!-- till here all links are active -->
        <div>
            <h2>Design and layout</h2>
            <p>Following the analysis phase, the development process moves on to the design phase, which is guided
                by the objectives document. Recognizing the incremental growth of websites and the potential lack of
                good design architecture, the methodology includes iteration to account for changes and additions over
                the life of the site. The design phase, which is divided into Information Design and Graphic Design,
                results in a detailed Design Document that details the structure of the website, database data structures,
                and CGI scripts.*
            </p>
            <p>The following step, design testing, focuses on early, low-cost testing to identify inconsistencies or
                flaws in the design. This entails comparing the website's design to the goals and objectives outlined in
                the first three steps. Phases One and Two involve an iterative loop in which objectives in the Objectives
                Document are revisited to ensure alignment with the design. Any objectives that are removed are added to
                the Wish List for future consideration.<sup>[17]</sup>

            <h2>Content creation</h2>
            <p>No matter how visually appealing a website is, good communication with clients is critical.
                The primary purpose of content production is to create a communication channel through the user
                interface by delivering relevant information about your firm in an engaging and easilyunderstandable manner.
                This includes:<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developing appealing calls to action</li>
                <li>Making creative headlines</li>
                <li>Content formatting for readability</li>
                <li>Carrying out line editing</li>
                <li>Text updating throughout the site development process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The stage of content production is critical in establishing the branding and marketing of your website
                or web application. It serves as a platform for defining the purpose and goals of your online presence
                through compelling and convincing content.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>During this critical stage, the website is built while keeping its fundamental goal in mind,paying close
                attention to all graphic components to assure the establishment of a completely working site.
            </p>
            <p>The procedure begins with the development of the main page, which is followed by the production of
                interior pages. The site's navigational structure is being refined in particular.
            </p>
            <p>During this development phase, key functionality such as the Content Management System, interactive
                contact forms, and shopping carts are activated.
            </p>
            <p>The coding process includes creating all of the site's software and installing it on the appropriate Web servers.
                This can range from simple things like posting to a Web server to more complex tasks like establishing database
                connections.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Testing, review and launch</h2>
            <p>In any web project, the testing phase is incredibly intricate and difficult. Because web apps are frequently
                designed for a diverse and often unknown user base running in a range of technological environments, their
                complexity exceeds that of traditional Information Systems (IS). To ensure maximum reach and efficacy, the website
                must be tested in a variety of contexts and technologies. The website moves to the delivery stage after gaining
                final approval from the designer. To ensure its preparation for launch, the quality assurance team performs rigorous
                testing for functionality, compatibility, and performance.
            </p>
            <p>Additional testing is carried out, including integration, stress, scalability, load, resolution, and cross-browser
                compatibility. When the approval is given, the website is pushed to the server via FTP, completing the development
                process.
            </p>
            <p>Key aspects in this step are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test Lost Links</li>
                <li>Use code validators</li>
                <li>Check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">browser</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Maintenance and updating</h2>
            <p>The web development process goes beyond deployment to include a variety of post-deployment tasks.</p>
            <p>Websites, in example, are frequently under ongoing maintenance, with new items being uploaded on a daily basis.
                The maintenance costs increases immensely as the site grows in size. The accuracy of content on a website is critical,
                demanding continuous monitoring to verify that both information and links, particularly external links, are updated.
                Adjustments are made in response to user feedback, and regular support and maintenance actions are carried out to
                maintain the website's long-term effectiveness.<sup>[17]</sup></p>

            <h1>Traditional development methodologies</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Debra Howcraft and John Carroll discussed a few traditional web development methodologies in their 
                research paper:<sup>[17]</sup>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Waterfall:</strong> The waterfall methodology comprises a sequence of cascading steps,
                    addressing the development process with minimal iteration between each stage. However, a significant
                    drawback when applying the waterfall methodology to the development of websites (as well as information
                    systems) lies in its rigid structure, lacking iteration beyond adjacent stages. Any methodology used
                    for the development of Web-sites must be flexible enough to cope with
                    change.<sup>[17]</sup>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM):</strong> Structured Systems Analysis
                    and Design Method (SSADM) is a widely used methodology for systems analysis and design in information
                    systems and software engineering. Although it does not cover the entire lifecycle of a development
                    project, it places a strong emphasis on the stages of analysis and design in the hopes of minimizing
                    later-stage, expensive errors and omissions.<sup>[17]</sup>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong>  Prototyping is a software development approach in which a preliminary version
                    of a system or application is built to visualize and test its key functionalities. The prototype serves as a
                    tangible representation of the final product, allowing stakeholders, including users and developers, to interact
                    with it and provide feedback.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Application Development:</strong>Rapid Application Development (RAD) is a software development
                    methodology that prioritizes speed and flexibility in the development process. It is designed to produce
                    high-quality systems quickly, primarily through the use of iterative prototyping and the involvement of
                    end-users.RAD aims to reduce the time it takes to develop a system and increase the adaptability to
                    changing requirements.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Incremental Prototyping:</strong> Incremental prototyping is a software development approach that
                    combines the principles of prototyping and incremental development. In this methodology, the development
                    process is divided into small increments, with each increment building upon the functionality of the previous one.
                    At the same time, prototypes are created and refined in each increment to better meet user requirements and
                    expectations.

            <h1>Key technologies in web development</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Developing a fundamental knowledge of client-side and server-side dynamics is crucial.<sup>[citation needed]</sup><p>
            <p>
                The goal of front-end development is to create a website's user interface and visual components that users may
                interact with directly. On the other hand, back-end development works with databases, server-side logic, and
                application functionality. Building reliable and user-friendly online applications requires a comprehensive
                approach, which is ensured by collaboration between front-end and back-end engineers.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Front-end development</h2>
            <p>Front-end development is the process of designing and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of 
                a web application. It involves creating visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact with directly. 
                The primary technologies and concepts associated with front-end development include:
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Technologies</h3>
            <p>The 3 core technologies for front-end development are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong> HTML provides the structure and organization
                    of content on a webpage.
                </li>
                <li><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet):</strong> Responsible for styling and layout, CSS enhances the presentation
                    of HTML elements, making the application visually appealing.
                </li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> It is used to add interactions to the web pages. Advancement in JavaScript has given
                    rise to many popular front- end frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>User interface design</h3>
            <p>User experience design focuses on creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable for users.
                It involves understanding user behavior, conducting usability studies, and implementing design principles to enhance
                the overall satisfaction of users interacting with a website or application. This involves wireframing, prototyping,
                and implementing design principles to enhance user interaction. Some of the popular tools used for UI Wireframing are -
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sketch for detailed, vector-based design</li>

            <div class="srver">
                <h3>Server/ cloud instance</h3>
                <p>An essential component of the architecture of a web application is a server or cloud instance. A cloud instance is a 
                    virtual server instance that can be accessed via the Internet and is created, delivered, and hosted on a public or 
                    private cloud. It functions as a physical server that may seamlessly move between various devices with ease or set up 
                    several instances on one server. It is therefore very dynamic, scalable, and economical.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="db">
                <h3>Databases</h3>
                <p>Database management is crucial for storing, retrieving, and managing data in web applications. Various database systems, 
                    such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, play distinct roles in organizing and structuring data. Effective database 
                    management ensures the responsiveness and efficiency of data-driven web applications. There are 3 types of databases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Relational databases:</strong> Structured databases that use tables to organize and relate data. 
                        Common Examples include - MySQL, PostgreSQL and many more.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>NoSQL databases:</strong> NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and 
                        can be more flexible than relational databases. They come in various types, such as document-oriented, key-value 
                        stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, CouchDB, Redis.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Document stores:</strong> Document stores store data in a semi-structured format, typically using JSON or 
                        XML documents. Each document can have a different structure, providing flexibility. Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Key-value stores:</strong> Key-value stores store data as pairs of keys and values. They are simple and 
                        efficient for certain types of operations, like caching. Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Column-family stores:</strong> Column-family stores organize data into columns instead of rows, making them 
                        suitable for large-scale distributed systems and analytical workloads. Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Graph databases:</strong> Graph databases are designed to represent and query data in the form of graphs. 
                        They are effective for handling relationships and network-type data. Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>In-memory databases:</strong> In-memory databases store data in the system's main memory (RAM) rather than 
                        on disk. This allows for faster data access and retrieval. Examples: Redis, Memcached.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Time-series databases:</strong> Time-series databases are optimized for handling time-stamped data, making 
                        them suitable for applications that involve tracking changes over time. Examples: InfluxDB, OpenTSDB.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>NewSQL databases:</strong> NewSQL databases aim to provide the scalability of NoSQL databases while 
                        maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of traditional relational databases. 
                        Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Object-oriented databases:</strong> Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, which can 
                        include both data and methods. They are designed to work seamlessly with object-oriented programming languages. 
                        Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.
                    </li>             
                </ul>
                <p>The choice of a database depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, 
                    performance considerations, and the specific use case of the application being developed. Each type of database has 
                    its strengths and weaknesses, and selecting the right one involves considering the specific needs of the project.
